0x0D. C - Preprocessor
The C - preprocessor is a macro preprocessor (allows you to define macros) that transforms your program before it is compiled. 
These transformations can be the inclusion of header files, macro expansions.
A macro is a fragment of code that is given a name. You can define a macro in C using the #define preprocessor directive.
